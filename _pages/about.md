I am a second year master student in Robotics Institution at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working at [LeCAR Lab](https://lecar-lab.github.io/) and [Air Lab](http://theairlab.org/), co-advised by [Prof. Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me/) and [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/). Previously I worked with [Prof. Yang Wang](https://magiclab.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) at [MAgIC Lab](https://magiclab.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) at ShanghaiTech University.

My work focuses on **designing algorithms to help robots handle environmental disturbances and model uncertainty**. I aim to enpower robotic systems to dynamically adapt environment changes in real-time and learn continuously in real-world scenarios, utilizing methodologies from both the learning and control communities.
